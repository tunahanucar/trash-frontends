# Pdf Viewer

I also coded a python artificial intelligence to extract the texts from the pdf and sound them out, but I did not add it because I could not optimize it sufficiently. After sufficient optimization, I will add my tesseract application with the completed frontend code. 

I would like to thank my History teacher **Nihat Paşa Yıldız** for the sample pdf.
